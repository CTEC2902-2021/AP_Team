As a team, we are working on a bespoke solution for our client. The website will display information about the best clubs in the premier league. Users will also have access to information about teams and players. Each team player will have a 'score: number of fans' and there will be an option for users to watch video segments of football games
as well as to leave comments and to reply to other user's comments.
